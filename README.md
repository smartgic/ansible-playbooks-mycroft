## Introduction
These Ansible playbooks will help you to install and configure Mycroft AI Voice Assistant on a Raspberry Pi 4B *(and later)* board with Raspberry Pi OS distribution.

Two types of playbook:
  - **Interactive**: asking questions to configure the roles used by the playbook
  - **Non-interactive**: using the default values from the roles or extra variables which override the default values

The playbooks could call different roles such as [prepi](https://github.com/smartgic/ansible-role-prepi) and [mycroft](https://github.com/smartgic/ansible-role-mycroft), these roles are available on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/smartgic) too.

Before running the playbooks, please have a look to the README of both of roles listed above.

The following image is the result of the install playbook execution:

### What does Ansible `prepi` role?

Using the `prepi` Ansible role will ensure your Raspberry Pi to be properly configured for the best of Mycroft experience.

The role will perform the following tasks _(depending your wish)_:

- Update Raspberry Pi OS to the latest version
- Add Debian backports repository _(customizable)_
- Update firmware using the `next` branch which provide kernel 5.10 _(customizable)_
- Update EEPROM using the `beta` version _(customizable)_
- Setup `initial_turbo` to speedup the boot process
- Overclock the Raspberry Pi to 2Ghz _(customizable)_
- Mount `/tmp` on a RAMDisk for Mycroft TTS cache files
- Optimize `/` partition mount options to improve SDcard read/write
- Enable I2C, SPI & UART interfaces _(customizable)_
- Set CPU governor to `performance` to avoid context switching between the `idle*` kernel functions _(customizable)_
- Install and configure PulseAudio (non-system wide) _(customizable)_

### What does Ansible `mycroft` role?

The role will perform the following tasks:

- Install and configure Mycroft AI Voice Assistant
- Myroft services integrated with systemd
- Extra skills installation
- `boto3`, `py_mplayer` and `pyopenssl` Python librairies installation
- RAMDisk support for IPC
- Configure Mycroft with custom user profile
- Optimize PulseAudio for Mycroft
- Protect Mycroft message bus service port `8181`

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4B board and later connected to your network
- [Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_arm64/images) _(required for board with more than 4GB of RAM)_
- Ansible 2.9 minimum *(follow [this guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html))*
- SSH up and running *([howto enable SSH on Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh))*

This repository provides a `requirements.yml` file which allows you to retrieve the roles from Ansible Galaxy `Smart'Gic` namespace.

```
$ cd ansible-playbooks-mycroft
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Example Playbooks

Inventory file with `rpi` group which has one host named `rpi4b01` with the IP address `192.168.1.97`.

```
[rpi]
rpi4b01 ansible_host=192.168.1.97 ansible_user=pi
```

Basic playbook running on `rpi` group using the `pi` user to connect via SSH _(based on the inventory)_ with some custom variables.

### Interactive playbook

Using the interactive _(asking questions)_ playbook to install and configure Mycroft.

```
$ cd ansible-playbook-mycroft
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory install-interactive.yml
```
